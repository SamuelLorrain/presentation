# Presentation

A small html/js/css project to create powerpoint style presentation

## Usage

- left and right arrows to change slides

## Adding slide

Each node that is a direct child from the body is considered a slide on it's own,
Each slide is then displayed one at the time.

To add a slide, just add a section node in the body of index.html

## Styling

There is some css styling to simplify the creation of slides.

```
center // center an element,
list // put element in a list fashion (flex-direction:column)
```
